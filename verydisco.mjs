Create a verydisco.mjs script that :

takes the 1st argument from the command 
line (after the program name)
makes it very disco:
cut each word from this argument 
in 2 (rounded up),
re-compose a word by concatenating 
the chunks in the other order
display the result in console
If the argument passed is a sentence, 
each word of the sentence must be "very disco".

For example:

discovery would print verydisco (üï∫üèº) in console.
Node is awesome would print deNo si omeawes in the console.
